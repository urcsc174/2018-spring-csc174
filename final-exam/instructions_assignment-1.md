# CSC 174  Optional Final Assignment 1: Information Architect

*Due: Friday, May 11, 2018 (last day of exam week)*

This is an **optional assignment**, only required if you need to do, or re-do the team role:

- **Information Architect**, only 
- but *not* Design Artist
- and *not* Technical Coder

For this assignment you only need to develop an Information Architecture.  You do not need to create the presentation layer (styles) nor behavior layer (scripts).

## Step 1: Topic

The professor will assign a domain (a topic) to you, and give you specific instructions regarding the primary and secondary goals of the website.

- [ ] Send a DM in Slack to the professor.  Say that you want to do *"Optional Final Assignment 1."*

The professor will reply with a domain that is unique to everyone else who is doing an optional final assignment.  

- [ ] You are required to use the domain the professor provides to build your architecture.  You may not add to it or embellish it.  Only do what the professor instructs you to do.

##  Step 2: Gather Content

Note: as you gather content, keep in mind you may have to edit it to meet the requirements below.  It's okay if you take content from Wikipedia and manipulate it within reason.  (And as always, remember to cite your sources in a logical place in the content.)

- [ ] Within the domain assigned by the professor, you choose the **ontology** (the limits of the domain) and compile content: text and images only
    - Four images (JPGs, PNGs, or GIFs only)
    - Text: at least 900 words

*Think ahead as you gather content.  You will need to "chunk" the content as described below.  Also, the images must relate to the content in some way.*

- [ ] Create a document outline (not necessarily in HTML yet) with lots of headings to divide the content into sections.
    - There must be a **choreography** (logical order) to the way you arrange the content.  
    - There must be **two major sections**, i.e. sub-topics, within the domain.
    - Each of the two major sections must have **four sub-divisions** (smaller sections)
    - Each sub-division must have **multiple headings** that logically divide it into smaller "chunks" of content using an clear and obvious **taxonomy** (consistent structure and language).
- [ ] Make sure you have short, captions for the images that relate to a specific area of the textual content in some way.

## Step 3: Structure the Content

You may have done this at the same time you did Step 2.

- [ ] Create two HTML documents using the HTML5 document template.
- [ ] Add your textual content from Step 2 and apply the appropriate HTML5 tags, ensuring all content and document structure is clean and semantically tagged.
- [ ] Write the appropriate HTML to insert your images and their captions into positions that make sense from a choreography standpoint.

## Step 4: Describe the Intended Presentation and Behaviors

- [ ] Create a markdown file named **readme.md** and add the following sections.
- [ ] Describe the **layout** that would promote the intended choreography - say how major sections of each page should be positioned within the viewport.  (Think *wireframes*.)

Describe the "mood" of the website (descriptions that will drive design choices):
  - [ ] Suggest the type of **typography (fonts)** that should be used.  
  - [ ] Suggest **color pallets and general embellishments** that would support the mood

## Step 5: Turn it in

Do **not** upload your files to the class webserver or share your files in any way.  

- [ ] ZIP (compress) your files (HTML, images, readme.md files only)
  - Please *downsample* your image files if necessary.  Do not send files over 1MB.)
- [ ] Upload your ZIP'd file to the assignment in Blackboard titled: **Final Assignment 1** on or before the due date.
