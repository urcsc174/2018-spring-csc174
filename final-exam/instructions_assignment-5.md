# CSC 174  Optional Final Assignment 5: Technical Coder

*Due: Friday, May 11, 2018 (last day of exam week)*

This is an **optional assignment**, only required if you need to do, or re-do the team role:

- **Technical Coder**, only
- but *not* Design Artist 
- and *not* Information Architect

For this assignment you need to take an existing Information Architecture and then add the behavior layer which includes use of a database.

## Step 1: Get the Information Architecture

The professor will provide you with a set of HTML files and set of instructions regarding the intended "mood" and layout of the website.  The files will be missing any but the most rudimentary styles (on purpose).  Your job is to apply the behavior layer (interactions), using styles only as a function of necessity.

- [ ] Send a DM in Slack to the professor.  Say that you want to do *"Optional Final Assignment 5."*

The professor will reply with a ZIP file that contains the files around which you will need to program the interactivity.

## Step 2: Install the Behavior Layer

- [ ] Using your localhost, create a **MySQL database** for powering the HTML forms using **PHP**
  - One HTML form for the **Contact Form**
  - One HTML form for the **User Account Creation** process 
  - One HTML form for the the **User Login** Process
  - As many HTML forms and PHP scripts as necessary to enable the **four database functions** (described earlier) in the administration area
- [ ] Ensuring that the entire website meets **web standards** and follows **best practices**

## Step 3: Turn it in

Do **not** upload your files to the class webserver or share your files in any way.  

- Export your MySQL database on your localhost to a file named **export.sql**

- [ ] ZIP (compress) all your files (including the .sql file) into a single ZIP file
- [ ] Upload your ZIP'd file to the assignment in Blackboard titled: **Final Assignment 5** on or before the due date.
