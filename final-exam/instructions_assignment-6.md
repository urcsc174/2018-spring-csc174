# CSC 174  Optional Final Assignment 6: <br>Design Artist

*Due: Friday, May 11, 2018 (last day of exam week)*

This is an **optional assignment**, only required if you need to do, or re-do the team role:

- **Design Artist**, only
- but *not* Technical Coder
- and *not* Information Architect

For this assignment you need to take an existing Information Architecture, and then create the presentation layer (styles).  You do not need to create the behavior layer (scripts).

## Step 1: Get the Information Architecture

The professor will provide you with a set of HTML files and set of instructions regarding the intended "mood" and layout of the website.

- [ ] Send a DM in Slack to the professor.  Say that you want to do *"Optional Final Assignment 6."*

The professor will reply with a ZIP file that contains the files around which you will need to write your styles.

## Step 2: Create the Presentation Layer

- [ ] You need to create a design (layout and embellishments) that supports the information architecture, i.e. you cannot make random choices.  You need to demonstrate your **use of styles in support of an information architecture**.

    - [ ] The layout needs to promote **the intended choreography**

    - [ ] The typography, color pallets and general embellishments must **support the intended "mood"** of the website

- [ ] The design must demonstrate your understanding of:

  - **Z- and F-Patterns** (layout) ...you need to one or both somewhere in the website
  - **C.R.A.P. Principles** (styling) ...you need to demonstrate at least three of the four

  Note: use of a **CSS Framework** is *optional* (not graded)

- [ ] Install **two well-paired fonts** and demonstrate your understanding of: Typography, in terms of **readability** and **legibility**

- [ ] Arrange your custom CSS code using any **CSS Architecture** (a standard architecture or your own variation)


  - Note: if you use a CSS Framework, you still need to demonstrate your understanding of CSS Architecture



## Step 3: Turn it in

Do **not** upload your files to the class webserver or share your files in any way.  

- [ ] ZIP (compress) your files (HTML, images only)

- [ ] Upload your ZIP'd file to the assignment in Blackboard titled: **Final Assignment 6** on or before the due date.
