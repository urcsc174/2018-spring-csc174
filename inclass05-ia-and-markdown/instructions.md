# In-class exercise 5: Information Architecture and Markdown

*Due: Monday, February 5, 2018* 

There are two goals of this exercise: (#1) practice putting together content into a meaningful structure (information architecture), and (#2) practice using "markdown."

For this exercise you need to gather sets of content from three separate and very different sources.  

- **Recommended:** go to Wikipedia.  Locate three different topics that interest you. 
- Even though the sources need to be very different, think of some *common thread* - something they do have in common.  (Be creative.)  E.g. cars, trains, and airplanes …they're all modes of transportation

Regarding *markdown*, here are some references:

- [Wikipedia: Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)


- [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)


## Requirements

- Create a markdown document (a plain text file with the file extension `.md`); name the file using your first initial and last name (e.g. **rkostin**)
- At the top of the markdown document, create and style heading information:
  - Title (what this document is about - the "domain" …the thing the three separate topics have in common)
  - Your name
  - The assignment name
  - Date
    …stuff like that
- Write a short paragraph (100 words or so) describing in a little more detail something about the three topics and what they have in common.  
- In the rest of this markdown document, you need to create a good structure using the principles of information architecture
  - There should be a clear **ontology**
  - The **taxonomy** should be consistant
  - The **choreography** (in this case, because it's one long scrolly document you just need to be concered about order)
- You need to embed at least three images somewhere in the document.
  - Create a subfolder named `media` and put the images in there 

- All told, you should have a document with around 500-700 words or so.  (We're not going to count the words, but you should be in the ballpark.)

*Hint: you need to create a structure with headings, paragraphs and other elements that shows commonality and/or differences as appropriate.  (Yes - this is the hard part of this exercise!)*

- Sync your markdown document with your **inclass exercise 4 repository**
- Open your respository in a web browser, pointed to the inclass exercise 4 repository
  - It'll look something like this:
    `https://github.com/urcsc174/inclass04-cityname`
    …where `cityname` is your team's city name
- Create a submission in Blackboard in the "Assignments" area, in the **In-class Excercise 5** assignment.  
  - Click the Write Submission button and paste your URL there
