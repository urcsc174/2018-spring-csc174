# CSC 174 Midterm Exam

*Due: Wednesday, April 11, 2018 (two weeks)*

The point of this take-home exam is to work independently and demonstrate your understanding of the concepts and technologies we've covered in CSC 174 so far.

## Requirements

There is a lot of flexibility in how you meet the requirements of this exam.  The key thing is to simply meet the requirements - you do not need to exceed them.

From a very high level, you need to: create a **small website** that uses a very simply HTML form that saves it's data in a MySQL database, and install it on our class web server; and document what you did in a **readme.md** file.  

*Note: use of a repository is not required for this assignment.  You'll submit your readme.md file in Blackboard.*

### Information Architecture

- Pick a topic - any - and build a two page informational website
  - The goal of the website is primarily to just present information about the topic
  - Secondarily, the goal of the website is to get users to sign-up for a newsletter
- In your **readme.md** file
  - Describe the domain and it's limits (the **ontology**)
  - Describe the **choreography** - the order you intend to reveal content to the user
  - [You do not have to describe the taxonomy - in such a small website, that would be overkill]
- Create your HTML pages using the HTML5 specification and demonstrate your understanding of good structure and semantic use of HTML tags

## Design

- Create a design around your topic that demonstrates your understanding of:

  - **Z- and F-Patterns** (layout) ...you need to use both
  - **C.R.A.P. Principles** (styling) ...you need to demonstrate at least three of the four

  Note: use of a **CSS Framework** is *optional* (not graded)

- Install **two well-paired fonts** and demonstrate your understanding of: Typography, in terms of **readability** and **legibility**

- Arrange your custom CSS code using any **CSS Architecture** (a standard architecture or your own variation)

  - Note: if you use a CSS Framework, you still need to demonstrate your understanding of CSS Architecture

- In your **readme.md** file

  - Explain your application of the Z-Pattern - why you put what you did in each quadrant
  - Explain your application of the F-Pattern - why you laid out what you did, from left-to-right
  - Describe the C.R.A.P. principles that exist in your website and explain what they achieve
  - Explain why you chose the fonts you did (and don't ever say, "because I like them.")
  - Explain the structure behind your CSS Architecture

## Technical Coding

- All HTML and CSS must **validate within reason**; all PHP must work without error
- File naming conventions and file sizes must follow **industry standards**
- Demonstrate your ability to use **PHP Includes** to factor out a reasonable amount of common-code across the two webpages
- Demonstrate your ability to write data from an **HTML form** to a **MySQL database** using a **PHP script**
- In your **readme.md** file
  - List the database credentials you used (database name, username, password)
  - Describe any worthwhile or interesting technical aspects of your website and/or any technical difficulties that didn't work out (you *may* receive credit for things attempted but not achieved)

## Other Requirements

Your midterm exam must be installed on the class webserver on or before the due date

- Upload your files into a directory using your regular, recognizable name (e.g. rkostin), inside the folder named "midterm" (already exists)
- Install your database on our Bluehost server
  - The database name and username must use your regular, recognizable name (e.g. urcscon3_rkostin)
- Create a submission in Blackboard
  - Upload your **readme.md** file to blackboard
  - Copy & paste a link to your website on the class webserver

Although the nature of web development is collaborative, the intent for this exam is to demonstrate your abilities to build a website independently.  Still however, you may "get inspiration" and even help from other websites and other students, but be very careful.  

- Copying someone else's code in large quantities without attribution is considered plagiarism. 
- Having someone else write your code is considered cheating.

Instances of plagiarism and cheating will be treated as such and submitted to the University's Board on Academic Honesty.  Be good!
