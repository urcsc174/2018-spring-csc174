# Assignment 4: Odd Team Member

*Due date for the **Information Architect**'s content and intent: **Monday, March 26, 2018***<br>*Due date for the final website: **Monday, April 2, 2018***

The goal of this assignment is to build on a previous IA while adding new, contrasting content while at the same time adding an HTML form that captures relevant information into a database.

This is a **team assignment**, however you will be graded for the work you do as an individual within the team.  

## Requirements

The team is responsible for delivering a website with the following elements:

- A **home** that serves as an introduction (i.e. index) to the rest of the website
- Information about **four students**, three of whom have something in common, and one that is different
- An **HTML form** to capture relevant information, i.e. information that has something to do with the content of the website, and a database to hold that information

Note: the three elements listed above do *not* have to be separate pages.  The Information Architect is free to structure the website any way they want.  For instance, a long scrolly webpage is okay, as long as you structure it right (think: choreography) and the Designer designs it right (think: F- or Z-patterns).  It is also okay to do a combination of long-scrolly plus other pages.

Each team member will be graded on the following:

- **Information Architect**
  - Integration of a forth, contrasting student webpage into an existing IA
  - Creation of the IA for an HTML form which includes the pre- and post-submit choreography
- **Design Artist**
  - Styling of every element of the website - especially the introduction of the forth, contrasting student webpage using the principles of page design and best practices of page layout and typography
- **Technical Coder** 
  - Creation of a MySQL database and powering of an HTML form using PHP to write POST data to the database
  - Ensuring that the entire website meets web standards and follows best practices

### Colophon

NOTE: for this assignment, there is new, detailed information required in the colophon for which each team member will be graded. The existence of the readme.md file is the responsibility of the IA, but the Designer and Coder sections within it are the responsibilities of the other team members.

The "colophon" must exist in a **readme.md** file in the team's GitHub repository that contains the following:

- **Team information**<br>*The IA provides this information...*
  - City-team name
  - Who did which role(s)
  - Website location (URL), GitHub location (URL), and database location (i.e. name)

- The **Information Architecture** Section<br>*Note: the IA needs to fill-out this section by the first due date and do this **instead** of leaving comments in the HTML (comments in the HTML didn't work out as I had hoped last time; maybe doing it this way will be better)*
  - Description of the rationale behind the **ontology** and **choreography** in the website, plus a listing of the **taxonomy** and relevant explanations, i.e. be really clear about how you chose to represent the students with something in common, versus the student who is different
  - **Layout** required by the information architecture - what major elements should be positioned where<br>*Note: it is **not** the IA's job to tell the designer where each element goes - only describe the major structural elements - for example: "The ASIDE needs to be positioned to the right of the ARTICLE" ...stuff like that.*
  - Suggestions for **typefaces/fonts**, and where and how they are to be applied<br>*Note: it is not necessary for the IA to select specific fonts - only the intent. For example: "the H2s should be styled using a large scripty-looking font that connotes fanciness because the students are fancy." ...stuff like that.*
  - Explanation about the **web form** and the INPUT elements that are used (explain how they are relevant in the ontology), and how the web form is supposed to work including what happens after the user clicks SUBMIT
    - Be specific about ALL the text - exactly what words go with what kind of INPUT fields and LABELs
    - Also be specific about the layout of the HTML form

  NOTE: having a JavaScript element on the homepage is *not* required for this assignment. It's okay if it continues to exist, but if it does it needs to be updated so it continues to be relevant.

- The **Design Artist** Section<br>*Note: the Designer needs to take direction from the IA, but only as described above.  Other than that, the Designer must make their own choices for which they will be graded*

  - Description of the rationale behind the color choices (foregrounds and backgrounds), borders/edges and other embellishments - how do they support the "mood" and intent as described by the Information Architect?
  - Describe and make references to the C.R.A.P. principles, page patterns, and typographic principles that were covered in previous classes, and be sure to explain why each was used where you used them
  - List of all typeface and font choices and where they are used in the website
  - List and write a short description about layout implementations and where they are used, for example: how you used CSS Flex, CSS Grid, et cetera

- The **Technical Coder** section<br>*Note: the coder section does not need much information - this can be really short because it'll be obvious what the coder did based on the code that exists in the website*

  - List any known bugs, deficiencies in the website due to plugins (e.g. validation errors), or things that just could not be figured out in the time allotted before the assignment was due

  NOTE: perfect code is *not* required for the coder to get an A, so long as the errors/problems/deficiencies are documented in the colophon ...within reason

## Installation

- The website must be installed on the class web server in the folder named: **assignment04** (â€¦which already exists); then create a folder with a name based on the team city that you're in.  
- The database must be created on the class web server using the city-team database created for your team

## Submit the Assignment

You will *each* create your own submission in Blackboard using the *assignment* that relates to the role you did.

- Create a Blackboard submission in: **Assignment 4: Odd Team Member (IA *or* Designer *or* Coder)** based on whatever you did.
- In the "Write Submission" area, submit a **link to the website** on the class web server
- Also write-in 
  - The **city-name** of your team
  - The names of **each team member** and the **role** they performed (including your own)
- Also, submit a **link to the repository** the team used.  (Make sure the repository is "public")
