# In-class exercise 1: Introduction to Slack
*Due: by the end of today's class, Wednesday, January 17, 2018*

# Requirements


- [ ] Your assignment is to login to the CSC 174 Slack Workspace and **create a post** in the **#chatter** channel:
  - Introduce yourself  - name, major, anticipated graduation date
  - Make a music suggestion: a song or band/artist that would make a good "seed" for the professor's Pandora app (no angry music please!)
   - Also, **add a reaction** (like a thumbs-up) to other students' music suggestions - in effect, vote for good suggestions
      
- [ ] Also, say *Hi* to at least three other students by clicking the **Reply to Thread** button and then say something nice.
That's it for today.
