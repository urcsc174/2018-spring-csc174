# In-class exercise 2: Initial Role
*Due: by the end of today's class, Monday, January 22, 2018*

Refer to the web team roles from last class:

- Information Architect
- Designer
- Coder (front and backend)

See here: [docs.urcsc174.org/lecture01-introduction/Introduction.pdf](http://docs.urcsc174.org/lecture01-introduction/Introduction.pdf)

# Requirements

- [ ] Pick one of the *three* roles for yourself (Remember: we're combining the front and backend jobs into one; just call it "coder")

  - Think (briefly) about why you think you would be a good one; jot down some notes (you'll need them later)

    - Do you have existing skills from previous courses/jobs? Or...
    - Do you have a desire to learn/get better with a particular set of skills?
  - Put together content - at least 200 words or so; may includes lists; picture(s); whatever you want (you'll be using this on a web page, later)

- [ ] Edit this [shared Google Sheet](https://goo.gl/pJcXcH)

  - Drag your name/email (as-is) to any one of the three "initial roles" on the right. (Note: order does not matter.)
