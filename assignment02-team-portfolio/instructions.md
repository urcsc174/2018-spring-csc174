# Assignment 2: Team Portfolio Website
*Due: Wednesday, February 7, 2018*

The goal of this assignment is to work as a web development team (IA, Designer, Coder) and cobble together three student portfolio websites into one, cohesive website.

# Requirements

Each team role will have a separate rubric by which each student will get a separate grade.

### Information Architect

NOTE: this is the primary focus of this assignment.  The IA will get the greatest scrutiny when being graded


- Re-architect the content following the principles of Information Architecture

  - Decide the ontology (what's in the domain)
  - Create a structure using the taxonomy (the document outline)
  - Choose an appropriate choreography for the content (navigation and order)

### Design Artist

Until we cover the design principles and other design-related topics in CSC 174, the Design Artist simply needs to make an attempt to make the website look interesting, and follow general best practices, applying a level of effort to demonstrate basic webpage design skills.  

### Coder

Until we cover new technical development skills in CSC 174, the Coder simply needs to make sure the website is technically perfect which includes: 

- The HTML and CSS must pass validation
- The website must use **PHP Includes** to factor-out common elements, e.g. the navigation element
  - Don't forget: the navigation element must indicate which is the current page
- The files and file system must be clean and follow industry best practices
## Installation

- The website must be installed on the class web server in the folder named: **assignment02** (â€¦which already exists); then create a folder with a name based on the team city that you're in.


## Submit the Assignment

To get credit for your work, **one person on your team** (usually your IA) will submit a link to your website in Blackboard, in the assignment: **Assignment 2: Team Portfolio Website**
