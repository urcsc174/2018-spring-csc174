- [ ] Pulls data from a MySQL table and **displays** it in an HTML table
- [ ] Ability to **add** new records to the table using an HTML form
- [ ] Ability to **delete** records from the table, selectively
- [ ] Ability to **edit/update** existing records in the table

Show your working solution to one of the TAs (today or Wednesday) for credit.
