# In-class Exercise 10: WordPress

*Due: today, in-class*

The purpose of this lab assignment is to practice installing and using a popular Content Management System, WordPress. 

## Install WordPress

- On your local MAMP or WAMP installation, create a new local database and associated user.
  - You can use one of the lab computers for this exercise
- Download WordPress from www.wordpress.org and copy the files into your local MAMP or WAMP installation
- Run the WordPress installation

## Customize the Site

- Using the Settings area, go into "General" and change the Site Title, Tagline, and some of the other settings
- Explore - and play with - the other areas under Settings; make some changes

## Load Content

- Copy & paste content from anywhere, upload images, create some Posts, create some pages

## Install a Theme

- Using the WordPress "Themes" utilities (under Appearance/Themes) use the "Add New Theme" widget to select, install, and activate a new theme.
  - Do NOT use one of the pre-installed Themes; click the **Add New** button and find a new, interesting (and fairly simple) Theme to install and activate

## Install a Plugin

- Using the WordPress "Plugins" utilities (under Plugins/Add New) use the "Add New" widget to select, install and activate a new plugin.

  - The plugin must be of the type that provides a FRONT-END extension, i.e. something you can see on the front-end website

  - **Good ideas include:** calendars; slide shows; contact forms; stuff like that
  - **Bad ideas include:** cache optimizers; utilities; analytics tools; et cetera
  - Basically, pick something that will be easy to see on the front-end and easy to grade!

## Demonstrate Your WordPress Website

- Show the TA or Professor your functioning WordPress website for *participation* credit.
