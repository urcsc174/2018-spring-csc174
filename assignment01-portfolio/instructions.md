# Assignment 1: Initial Portfolio Website
*Due: Monday, January 29, 2018*

The goal of this assignment is to simply apply a lot of the basic skills you learned in CSC 170.  Note: because this assignment requires use of PHP Includes, it would help to use a *localhost* during the development process.

# Requirements


- [ ] Create **a styled, two page website** using the information, previously gathered about yourself on one page, and information about your selected, *Initial Team Role* in CSC 174.
  - The HTML must be **semantically correct**, **properly structured**, and **valid** according to the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
  - The CSS must exist in an **externally linked stylesheet** and set some basic formatting **embellishments** (fonts, colors, layout), and the CSS must be **valid** according to the to the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    - Note: there will be a subjective aspect to the rubric - it must look like you made an attempt to make the website look interesting (even if it looks terrible; we'll work on that later this semester)
    - Hint: you don't have much content; try using large fonts
  - Both pages must look like they belong together, using common elements that look and work as expected (for example, a common header and common navigation element)

  ### PHP Includes and the Website Navigation Element

  - The website must use **PHP Includes** to factor-out common elements, e.g. the navigation element
  - Don't forget: the navigation element must indicate which is the current page (and the fact that it's only a two page website makes this a challenge!)
  - Also don't forget: because the navigation will be in a PHP Include, you need to use a solution to insert the *is-current* class (or whatever you're using) on the appropriate navigation element.  You can look-up any solution you want, or just you the JavaScript I provided back in CSC 170 [linked in a ZIP file, here](menu-highligher.js.zip)

- [ ] The files and file system must be clean and follow industry best practices

      - No unused files
      - Files of certain types (e.g. images, CSS, includes) must be properly sorted into sub-directories
      - Folder names and filenames must be logical and make sense for what they contain (and one of the files must be named: **index**)
      - Image files must be properly optimized and appropriately sized for the web


## Installation


- [ ] The website must be installed on the class web server in the folder named: **assignment01** (â€¦which already exists); then create a folder with a name in the pattern of first-initial, last name, e.g. **rkostin**, (or you can make it the same as your URID), and put your website in there


### Web Server Credentials

Everyone will use the same FTP account in this class so be careful when you're working on the web server!  Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.urcsc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: students@urcsc174.org
FTP Password: coffee1N/!18
```
