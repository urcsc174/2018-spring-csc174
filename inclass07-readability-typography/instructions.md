# In-class exercise 7: Readability and Typography

*Due: Monday, February 19, 2018* 

In this exercise you will take existing content with an pre-established layout and demonstrate your ability to increase readability by applying the design principles covered in class. 

## Step 1: Start with the Starter Files

- Download and open the [starter files here (ZIP)](starter-files-7.zip)

In the starter files you'll find existing content in a pre-established layout.

HINT: temporarily turn on borders on all the structural elements so you can better see the layout.  

Try this:

 `header, .hero, article, aside, footer, ul.flowing-boxes li { border: 1px solid hotpink; }`

...and don't forget to remove that as you develop your design (and definitely before you turn-in the assignment!)

## Step 2: Apply Styles, Fonts

The key to this exercise is to *not* randomly apply styles like we did in CSC 170, rather use reasons and a rationale to apply just the right styles in just the right ways to make the webpage more legible and readable.  

### Explain Your Choices

As you complete the requirements (below), you need to: **write comments in the CSS file that explain the rationale for each set of styles you write.**

Examples:

- explain the typefaces you chose...

```css
/* I picked these typefaces, monsarrat and finociario, becuase they portray a mood of...
   (and so on) */
```

- explain EACH application of the box model...

```css
/* I added padding to these elements to move the content away from the border, increasing readability of the section... (and so on) */
```

EVERY addition to the CSS needs to be explained in comments!

### Requirements

Using CSS, you need to make these improvements.

- Improve the legibility and readability of this webpage using CSS

- Install two custom fonts
  - Beware!  Make sure the fonts pair well and actually make sense considering the content
  - Focus on legibility and readability

- Apply styles to improve the design, focusing on the CRAP principles

Note: do not bother applying a layout; just use the one provided (a combination of CSS Grid and CSS Flex)

## When you're done...

- Upload this assignment to the class web server (anywhere, really)
  - Note: use of a repository for this assignment is not required
- To get credit for your work, submit a link to your webpage in Blackboard, in the assignment: **In-class exercise 7: Readability and Typography**
