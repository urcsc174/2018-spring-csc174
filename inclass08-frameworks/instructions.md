# In-class exercise 8: Frameworks

*Due: Wednesday, February 21, 2018 (today)* 

The point of Assignment 5 is to try out using a front-end CSS framework on a new version of your student portfolio website.  

- Start from scratch.  Create one HTML page.
- *Steal* your content from your Assignment 1: Initial Portfolio Website - just the part about yourself, not the team role page
  - Keep handy, but don't install your CSS


- Install of a front-end CSS framework
  - Install Bootstrap, Material, or some other similar front-end CSS framework
  - Install of an "override" CSS file
- Make extensive use of your chosen front-end CSS framework
  - Redesign the entire webpage using the framework styles only
  - All elements must be styled to make a good/normal quality website presentation (as you'd expect from any website)
- Override styles using your **override.css** to make the webpage look customized
  - Refer to your original CSS
- Upload your webpage to the class webserver (anywhere) and provide a link to it in Blackboard, in **In-class Exercise 8: Frameworks**
