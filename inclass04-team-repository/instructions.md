# In-class exercise 4: Setup a team repository in Github

*Due: Wednesday, January 31, 2018* 

## Requirements

- [ ] Join a "City Team" (if not already): [https://goo.gl/fs24U6](https://goo.gl/fs24U6)
- [ ] One team member, typically the IA (Information Architect): create a *private* channel for your City Team in Slack.
      - Name the channel: **assignment02-city** where "city" is your team's city name, e.g. "inclass04-SanFrancisco"
      - Invite your team members
      - Invite the **Professor**
      - Invite ALL the TAs: **Ben**, **Ali**, **Jorge**, **Rose**, **Tarin**
        (TAs: you might want to adjust your notification settings - it may get noisy!)
      - NOTE: don't get too attached to this channel - it will only be used for one assignment (Assignment: 2: Team Portfolio Website).  You guys will be creating new channels each time you work with a new team.
- [ ] Create (or convert) an individual "Education" Github account [https://education.github.com](https://education.github.com)
- [ ] One team member, typically the IA: create a repository in Github

  - Name it: **inclass04-city** where "city" is your team's city name, e.g. "inclass04-SanFrancisco"
  - Include a **readme.md** file
- [ ] Invite the other team members as **collaborators**
- [ ] Everyone in the team, "clone" the repository
- [ ] One team member (IA, usually) create a file locally, then add and sync (sometimes called "push" or "publish") the file to Github 
      - The file must be plain text - you can call it whatever you want, e.g. "shopping list.txt"
      - Fill the file with several lines of text
      - Check the file in Github - make sure your local edits end up online
- [ ] Let your team know (via your private channel in Slack) that the repository has been created and updated
      - Optional: you can play around with installing the Github app in Slack; it will automatically create a Slack message whenever your repository is updated
- [ ] Everyone else in the team: sync with the repository (pull the updates),then edit the file locally and then sync the updates with Github
- [ ] If a conflict (a.k.a. collision) occurs - which would be good practice, so try to make it happen - fix it!
- [ ] When everyone has made updates and succfully synced them with the repo in Github, leave a message in your private Slack channel using the keyword: "**professor**" and say, "**We've completed In-class exercise 4.**"  

  - Due date: next Wednesday, January 31
  - Soon, the professor or TAs will log your work in Blackboard as "pass"
