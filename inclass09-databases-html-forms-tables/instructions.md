- Create a **table** with a key field (auto)and at least two other columns (fields)
- Create a **simple HTML form** that captures user data and puts that data into your database
- Create another simple HTML webpage that reads the database and displays the **data in an HTML table**
- **Export** your data from the database and ZIP it together with your HTML files and upload it to Blackboard
